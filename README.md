# Smart Laundry Management System  
**Academic Project | Feb 2022 - May 2022**  

## 🚀 Overview  
The **Smart Laundry Management System** is an **IoT-powered** solution that tracks **washing machine status and drying conditions** using sensors. The system uses:  
- **Gyroscope Sensors** – Detect machine vibrations (On/Off status).  
- **Temperature Sensors** – Identify whether clothes are **dry or wet**.  
- **Wi-Fi Modules** – Transmit real-time data to **Arduino Cloud** for processing.  

Additionally, we implemented **secure authentication and data protection** for users' credentials and payment details using **SHA-256 & AES encryption**.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
- **IoT Components:** Gyroscope Sensor, Temperature Sensor, ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module  
- **Cloud:** Arduino Cloud  
- **Security:** SHA-256, AES Encryption  
- **Programming:** Python, C++ (Arduino)

## 📜 Project Files  
📁 `Diagrams/` – Circuit schematics and system architecture  
📁 `Firmware/` – Arduino code for sensor integration  
📁 `Simulation/` – Python-based sensor data simulation  
📁 `Security/` – Sample encryption scripts for data protection

## 📥 How to Use (For Simulation)  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Laundry-Management.git  
   cd Smart-Laundry-Management

### **Additional Recommendations:**  
- **Simulate Sensor Data** in Python (e.g., generate random values for temperature & motion).  
- **Use Fritzing** to create a **circuit diagram** for visualization.  
- **If you wrote an Arduino script**, include it under a `Firmware/` folder.  
- **Document Security Implementation** in the `Security/` folder.
