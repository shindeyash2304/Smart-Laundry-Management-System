# Smart Laundry Management System  
**Academic Project | Feb 2022 - May 2022**  

## 🚀 Overview  
The **Smart Laundry Management System** is an **IoT-powered** solution that tracks **washing machine status and drying conditions** using sensors. The system uses:  
- **Gyroscope Sensors** – Detect machine vibrations (On/Off status).  
- **Temperature Sensors** – Identify whether clothes are **dry or wet**.  
- **Wi-Fi Modules** – Transmit real-time data to **Arduino Cloud** for processing.  

Additionally, we implemented **secure authentication and data protection** for users' credentials and payment details using **SHA-256 & AES encryption**.
